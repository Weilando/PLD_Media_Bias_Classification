# DKE 2021 Home Project

This repository contains the home project for the Data and Knowledge Engineering class 2021 at Heinrich Heine University.  
The project exercise can be completed at home, using the expertise and skill sets acquired in the DKE 2021 lectures.  
Use this repository to prepare your solution. 

A grade improvement is given when the following criteria is met:
* You provided a working solution to the problem and your results are reproducible. 
* You submitted the solution in time and in the specified format. 
* Your classification algorithm yields a reasonable performance on the classification task. You will find the precise score to beat here before the project starts. 



## Topic: PLD Media Bias Classification
The home project deals with the classification of media bias of PLDs linked in tweets. I.e. given a link to e.g. a news outlet in a tweet, is this news outlet left-biased or right-biased? For this project, we will use the tweets and their metadata for classification.
