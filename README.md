## Topic: PLD Media Bias Classification
The home project deals with the classification of media bias of PLDs linked in tweets. I.e. given a link to e.g. a news outlet in a tweet, is this news outlet left-biased or right-biased? For this project, we will use the tweets and their metadata for classification.
